## Synopsis

This is the codebase behind [EBWiki.org](http://ebwiki.org), a site dedicated to documenting instances where people of color are killed by Law Enforcement Officers during routine interactions.

## Example


## Motivation

After the Walter Scott video was released showing the vast discrepancy between the official report of the encounter and the video, a group of Black technologists had the idea of a site where information on each encounter could be stored and recorded. This would help show both the frequency with which this occurs as well as the way bias affects the proceedings.

## Installation

TODO: Provide greater detail on installing EBWiki from scratch

## Testing

We use [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec) to test the business logic. In addition, we use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/BOWiki/BOW/) as a Continuous Integration (CI) Server and [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/BOWiki/BOW) to monitor the quality of the code.
